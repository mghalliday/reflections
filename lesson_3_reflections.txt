CREATING REPOSIORY ON GITHUB

(log in, click on + at top right, then on new repository, give it a name and leave as public, if you didn't already have content you would also check 'Initialize this repository with a README'. Then back to command line...)

$ git remote                    # show current remotes
$ git remote add origin url     # add repository origin as a remote

(url can be copied from git hub web page)

$ git remote -v                 # show details of current remotes (-v)
origin url1 (fetch)             # url to fetch from github
origin url1 (push)              # url to push to github (may be same)

$ git push origin master        # push to remote origin from master branch 

(refresh page on github to see that repository has been copied)

(use remote repository for the following reasons:

1. To collaborate with a team of developers
2. To make code freely available for others to share
3. To store code in a platform independent way
4. To store code where it is not vulnerable to accidental deletion
5. To store code where it is not vulnerable to breakdown of the machine where it is stored
6. To store code where it is not vulnerable to obsolescence of the machine where it is stored
